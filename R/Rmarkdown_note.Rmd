## Introduction 
### Brief Summary
Rmarkdown is to write *reproducible reports with R*. Use it to embed R code chunk and results into kinds of document. Usually, it is required to wrap a complete report up at the first half and put code and additional figures at the second half together with literatures as references.
### Workflow
1. open a new Rmarkdown file in Rstudio as .Rmd file
2. Write content, using Pandoc and .Rmd syntax
   + lists as this one or unordered startwith *
   + *Rmd Italic* **Rmd Bold**
   + #Header1 ##Header2
   + Inline R code, `r Sys.time() Sys.Date()`
   + Links as 
       + https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf
       + [rmarkdown_cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
   + Block quotes

3. Embed R code chunk
4. Render, replace R code with output. 

## R code chunk
``` {r}

```
### Options, here is the table 
Option | Default  |Effect
-------|----------|-------
eval   |TRUE      |Whether to evaluate the code and include its results
echo   |TRUE      |Whether to display code along with its results
include|TRUE      |If FALSE, knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.
tidy   | FALSE    |Whether to reformat code in a tidy way when displaying it
results| "markup" |"markup", "asis", "hold", or "hide"
fig.width  |7     |Width in inches for plots created in chunk
fig.height |7     |Height in inches for plots created in chunk

## Appendix
### Code

```{r Question1 Ref, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, prompt=TRUE, tidy=TRUE} 
 ## no output only code
```


```{r Question2 Ref, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, prompt=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}

```

### Citations

```{r, citations, echo=F, message=F}                               
citation("tidyverse")                           ## citations for packages
```



### Session Information                                              
```{r, echo=F}
## The session information contains the versions of R          
##and all packages used in the analysis contained in your R Markdown file.
MA.session = sessionInfo(package = NULL)
print(MA.session)
```
